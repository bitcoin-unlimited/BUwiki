# Voting's Impossible Triangle
*The ideal attributes of democratic voting procedures are in conflict, necessitating tradeoffs*

<img align="right" src="/election_impossible_triangle.svg" width=400></img>

Any good voting process<sup>1</sup> has desirable attributes which can be summarized by three adjectives:

**Integrity** refers to whether the vote correctly reflects the true choice of every participant, without intimidation or incentivization.  It also encompasses techniques that prove or disprove integrity.  In particular, the voting process itself can be considered as having a higher integrity than another process if it allows such techniques.

**Anonymity** refers to the ability of participants to cast votes anonymously.

**Remotability** is a new word, referring to whether participants can, and the processes required to, participate without appearing at designated physical locations.   "Remotability" has become very important during the Covid19 pandemic across many systems and processes.  However, it is often seen as desirable to increase democratic engagement, and many jurisdictions have had some remote capability for years, commonly referred to as an "absentee" ballot.

Recent attention to electronic and blockchain-based voting processes allow researchers to analyze practical systems using clean, theoretical models.  This activity has made it clear that these attributes are fundamentally opposed in many respects, in ways that perhaps the messy possibilities of physical presence and paper ballot election processes have previously obscured.

## Footnotes
**1** A voting process covers the specific system and activities required to identify participants and formally solicit their (possibly weighted) opinion.  Terms like elections, referendums, and the passage of bills are both too specific and cover additional activities.
