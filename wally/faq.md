## Can you give a SUMMARY OVERVIEW of the Wally Wallet?
Yes. The Wally Wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet focused on Bitcoin Cash whose design center is ease of use, simplicity, and useful features. In addition, Wally supports various experimental and test cryptocurrencies as an aid for developers.

Wally’s main screen is used for 90% of what you do with a wallet: sending, receiving, and showing account balances. Wally allows you to specify the amount of BCH you want to send in either mBCH or in local currencies. Wally offers multiple accounts, multiple local currencies, help in finding merchants that accept bitcoin cash, a unique “identity” feature that provides ultra secure logins to internet sites, and other helpful features.

## With which devices is Wally compatible?
The Wally Wallet is compatible with Android devices running Android 8.0 (Oreo) or later. Generally, most new phones and tablets made in 2018 are therefore compatible.

## What is mBCH?
mBCH stands for millibitcoincash. Each mBCH is one thousandth of a BCH (1000 mBCH = 1 BCH).  Other common terms are not used by Wally. These include microbitcoincash, which equals 1 millionth of a BCH (1,000,000 uBCH = 1 BCH) and a Satoshi, which is one hundred millionth of a BCH (100,000,000 Satoshi = 1 BCH).

## How is my mBCH protected from theft?
Your funds in your Wally Wallet are protected by several levels of security. First, the password for your device protects Wally from bad actors accessing your wallet. We recommend that you **use a strong device password** to protect access to all of your apps. Secondly, each account that you set up in Wally can optionally have its own **account PIN**. For example, you might want to have an account without a PIN for small everyday purchases and another account with a PIN that contains a larger amount of BCH. A third level of security is achieved via **invisible accounts**. When you set up an account with a PIN, you can choose to make that account invisible. Only when you enter the PIN will the account and it's balance be displayed. Without their PINs, no one could know of the existence of invisible accounts.

**A few comments on security**:  Strong passwords and PINs make brute force access (i.e., trying every possible PIN) much more difficult than weak ones.  Account PINs protect your funds from unsophisticated theft. There is always the remote chance that a thief with sufficient technical knowledge or root access to your device could theoretically gain access to your funds. Besides passwords, PINs, and invisible accounts, you can also incorporate schemes like having two invisible accounts, one of which you are willing to divulge to a knowledgeable and threatening thief, and the other which holds most of your funds.  

## Sending mBCH
The first step in sending mBCH is obtaining the Bitcoin Cash public ID address to which you want to send the mBCH. Using your email, messaging, or other means, obtain the recipient's Bitcoin Cash address and copy it into the clipboard of your device. Alternatively, you can use the QR Code scan symbol on the main screen of Wally to activate the camera on your device to scan in a recipient's address QR Code. The address will automatically be copied into the **SEND** section of your Wally Wallet.

The **SEND** section at the top of Wally's home page is used to send mBCH.  Use the pull down menu to the right of the words **SEND from** to select account from which the mBCH will be sent. Next, if the recipients address hasn't already automatically appeared on the next line, select the clipboard icon on the right side of Wally's **SEND** line. This will paste the recipient's address from the clipboard into the line below **SEND**. The third and last line of Wally's **SEND** section is used to select the currency type and the amount of currency. At this time, you can choose a local (fiat) currency or mBCH using the pull down menu on the right. Finally enter the send quantity in the **Amount** field and then select the SEND button to complete sending the mBCH. (Note: if you specified an amount of local currency, the equivalent amount of mBCH will sent.)

More Information: See above and below for mBCH, LOCAL CURRENCY, MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS

## How do I get the address to which I want to send mBCH into the send address field?
Simply copy an address into your device's clipboard, and it will automatically be loaded into the send address field on Wally's home page.

## Receiving mBCH
The middle of the Wally home page is used for receiving mBCH. If the sender already has your public ID address for the account into which you want the mBCH sent, you do not have to do anything. The mBCH will appear in your account after it is sent. If you need to provide your public ID address to the sender, use the pull down menu to the right of **Receive into** to select the account into which you want the mBCH sent. The address for that account will appear right below the **Receive into** line and also the QR Code for that address will be displayed. Either send your address to the sender (see the next FAQ) or have them scan the displayed QR Code.

## How do I send my Wally BCH public ID address to someone who wants to send me BCH?
Your Wally Wallet's BCH public ID address is too long to reliably recite it to someone who is going to send you BCH. Instead, touch the address immediately underneath the word "Receive" on Wally's home page, and that address will be copied to the clipboard of your device. 

 1. If you want to send the address via gmail, select the gmail icon in the green band at the top of the Wally's home page. An email will be displayed with the Wally bitcoin cash address automatically inserted into the body of the email. Fill in the email's "To" field and send it. 
 2. Alternately, select the share icon in the green band at the top of Wally's home page. A drop down menu will be displayed that will give you various options, such as mail, messages, or save-to-drive that you can select and use to share the Wally bitcoin cash address. In general, the address will automatically be loaded into the share option chosen.


## Using Wally, how do you specify the amount of BCH that you want to send in terms of the LOCAL CURRENCY?
First, choose the local currency by selecting the Settings symbol (a gear) at the top right of the Wally home page.  At the top of the Settings page, use the pull down menu to select the local currency of your choice.  Once a local currency is set it will remain set unless you use Settings to change it.  

On Wally's home page, below SEND, there is an address line showing the address to which the BCH will be sent. Below the address line is the AMOUNT line where you enter the "send quantity" of mBCH or local currency that you wish to send.  If you wish to change the type of currency shown next to the "send quantity" field, select the down arrow to the right of the currency, and then choose either your local currency or mBCH from the pull down list.

## How does Wally determine TRANSACTION FEES?
Wally automatically determines the transaction fee that is part of each send transaction.  The fee is just over one Satoshi per byte of information in your send transaction. Usually, around 200 to 250 bytes are in a transaction, but a transaction that requires multiple addresses to cover the amount being sent can rarely exceed 1000 bytes. In US currency, a typical transaction fee is only one fiftieth of a penny.


## How do we SPLIT A BILL using Wally?
When you pay a bill, other people with whom you are equally sharing the expense can easily send you their portion of the bill. Under "Receive" on the Wally home page, select "SPLIT A BILL". On the page that is displayed, fill in the total amount of the bill and the tip. You can enter a specific tip amount or select the percentage tip by touching the arrow to the right of "Tip". Next, select the number of ways you are splitting the bill.  The amount each person will be paying is then shown in mBCH and in the local currency, and your address QR code is displayed to make it easy for people to send you mBCH.

## When specifying local currency to send BCH, does Wally use a fair exchange rate?
When you specify an amount in local currency to send to someone, Wally obtains the up-to-date exchange rate for that currency from the BITCOIN.COM web site and uses that exchange rate to calculate the amount of mBCH to be sent. BITCOIN.COM derives its exchange rate from a basket of exchanges. The rate is sort of an average exchange rate. 

Remember that no actual local currency is being sent, just an equivalent value of mBCH is being sent, and there are absolutely no exchange fees involved. Finally, there is always a very remote possibility that for some unforeseen technical reason, the exchange rate might be somehow incorrect.  Wally shows you the exchange rate for one BCH before you send any funds, which you can glance at to confirm that it is reasonable.

## Why does Wally offer MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS?
One use for having several accounts is to track your spending by, for example, using one account for business and one account for personal expenses. You may also want to isolate received funds and spent funds on a project or other specific basis. You may also want to have one or more "invisible accounts" in addition to your visible accounts for security reasons.  Looking to the future, Wally may support several cryptocurrencies, each of which would have it's own account or accounts.

## How do I set up a Wally account?
You can set up multiple accounts by touching the green "**+**" symbol to the right of the Account Balances line on Wally's home page. The **New Account** page will be displayed. Enter an account name of your choice. Account names can be from 1 to 8 characters (letters, numbers, or symbols) long. Next, select the type of cryptocurrency from those listed on the pull down menu to the right of the **Blockchain** line. Bitcoin Cash is the default, and the other choices include experimental and test blockchains. If you would like to require a PIN in order to access this new account, type in a numeric PIN on the line provided.

**Important note!**  You will need each account's PIN to access the funds in each account, so remember the PINS forever and also write them down and save them somewhere safe. Secondly, after setting up each account, be sure to go to Wally's settings page and write down the Account Recovery Secret Phrase for each account.  (See SETTINGS below.) 

## How do I recover a lost account or a lost wallet?
Lost accounts are accounts that were destroyed because your phone was lost or destroyed, or because Wally was deleted, or because you forgot that account's PIN. To recover an account whose PIN was lost, select the green + symbol on Wally's home page, and then type the account's Recovery Secret Phrase where indicated on the New Account page. Recovery may take will some time, so be patient. Without the PIN or the Account Recovery Secret Phrase your account and it's contents are lost forever.

If all your accounts were destroyed (e.g.,your phone was lost or Wally was deleted) install a new copy of Wally on a device and as above, type in the Account Recovery Secret Phrase for each account, letting each account be recovered before entering the next account's Recovery Secret Phrase. Wally will examine the BCH blockchain and using the data in the blockchain, Wally will fully restore your account(s). Each account will take some time, so be patient.
 
## What information does Wally show me about my ACCOUNT BALANCES?
 The lower section of Wally's home page shows a list of your accounts and their balances. Balances are are shown in mBCH. If the amount shown is green, all transactions for the account have been settled. If an orange amount is shown to the right or the green amount, one or more send and/or receive transactions are in progress. For send transactions, the green amount is the mBCH you have available for sending, and the orange amount shows the amount of mBCH "change" that is temporarily unavailable while the transaction is being processed. Remember that when you send mBCH, your transaction amount, your transaction fee, and one or more or your addresses containing enough BCH  to cover the transaction are sent to the the world's BCH nodes.  The BCH node that successfully mines the next block of transactions extracts your send amount and your transaction fee from the addresses, and then returns any "change" to your wallet . The amount you will receive in "change" is displayed in orange. When sends are settled, the orange amount will be added to the account's green total, and the orange amount will disappear.
 
When receiving mBCH, the amount received will be shown in orange to the right of the amount previously in the account. Once the transaction is settled, the received amount will be added to account's total and the orange received amount will disappear. 

## Can I see my ACCOUNT HISTORY?
Yes. Under Account Balances, just tap on an account name and a Account History page will be displayed.

## How do I find stores that accept bitcoin cash?
Select the "Shop" icon at the bottom of Wallly's home page. Wally's "Stores and Merchants" page will be displayed, showing a list of websites that either help you find what you are looking for or take you directly there. When you select an item from the list, your device's web browser will display the selected website. The first item on the list is bitcoin.com's actively maintained map showing the location worldwide of stores that accept bitcoin cash. Other items include lists of merchants, casinos, and favorite websites that you have placed on the list.

**(Note to software engineer: The bitcoin.com site with the map is https://map.bitcoin.com/.  A list of merchants that accept bitcoin cash is at https://acceptbitcoin.cash/.  A list of casinos that accept bitcoin cash is at https://wizardofodds.com/banking/cryptocurrency/Bitcoin-Cash/ and another one at https://www.casinonewsdaily.com/casino-deposit-methods/casinos-accepting-bitcoin-cash/.**  
 
## How does the IDENTITY feature make my life easier?
Once you've set up your identity for a supported web site, you can use Wally to log into that web site on any device in an ultra secure manner. Just select the QR scan button on Wally's home page and use your device to scan the QR code on the web site's login page. Not only will you be logged in but additional information that you have pre-approved will be sent to the web site, such as your name, address, credit card number, or telephone number. This saves you from having to supply such information every time you log in. 

## Why are logins using IDENTITY so secure?
When Wally scans the login QR presented by a website, Wally initiates the login by requesting a cryptographic challenge string from that website. The website then sends the challenge. Wally, using your cryptographic ID, processes the string, proves that it is your device/wallet that is requesting the login, and sends back the proof. Once the website sees the proof, it logs you in without any need for you to risk entering your user name or password using a keyboard. Among other benefits, key logger attacks are completely foiled.
 
## How do I enter my identity information.
Select the Identity icon at the bottom of Wally's home page.  The **Identity** page will be displayed. A list of web sites that support the Identity feature is displayed. Select one of these web sites and a page showing a list of your identity information is displayed along with a switch for each item on the list. Items supported by the web site are in black, and identity items not supported are in grey. (Note to self: How does one populate the identity info. Has this been implemented yet?)  Turn on the switch for any item that you wish to pass to the web site when logging in.  (How does one get a URL onto the web site list?)

## What Wally features can I control using the SETTINGS page?

 1. LOCAL CURRENCY. Select the gear icon at the top of Wally's home page to go to the settings page. The first line on the settings page allows you to select your preferred local currency. Use the pull down menu on the right to see the available local currencies, and select the currency of your choice.
 2. ACCOUNT RECOVERY SECRET PHRASE. The second section of the settings page requires your special attention. After setting up an account, you should immediately write down the account's secret phrase and store it in a safe place. This will allow you or anyone else to recover your funds if your wallet is lost or destroyed. Keep your secret phrase secret.
 
  ***!!WARNING!!*   If the Wally app is accidentally deleted or your device goes bad, is destroyed, is lost, is stolen, or if any other mishap occurs preventing you from accessing your wallet, you will lose your BCH unless you have written down and safely stored your account recovery secret phrase.**
  
 3. BCH NODE PREFERENCES. Advanced users may want to set one of the BCH node options. When these are not set, Wally chooses a random BCH node to validate your send transactions. Furthermore, Wally will occasionally switch to a different random node to further insure your security. The Simplified Payment Validation (SPV) standard is used to ensure rapid execution of transactions. Users that want a particular node to validate their transactions (such as their own BCH node if they are running one) may set Wally to only use that node or, alternately, to preferably us that node. To enable these choices, select one of the red buttons in the third section of the settings page and enter the node's domain name or its IP address.
 4. ACCOUNT SETTINGS. The third section of the setting page allows you to view an account's Account Recovery Secret Phrase, to assess unconfirmed transactions, to rediscover all transactions, to delete accounts, and to make an account invisible.  Use the drop down menu located immediately below **Account Settings** to select the account that you want to manage, and then select one of these five operations.

***!!WARNING!**!* When deleting an account, all the mBCH in the account will be lost forever.




## Glossary of Terms

**Address or Bitcoin Cash address**
An address in a BCH wallet. When sending BCH, the address of the recipient is specified to ensure that the BCH is sent to the correct recipient. Each address is completely unique, as the probability of a duplicate address being created is infintesimally small.

**BCH** 
Abbreviation for both “bitcoin cash” (the currency) and the Bitcoin Cash Network. See below.

**Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, bitcoin, and bitcoin cash**
Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash (note the names are capitalized) refer to the electronic networks that process transactions made with bitcoin and bitcoin cash (note the lower case names). The names bitcoin and bitcoin cash refer to the electronic currency itself, as in “I own 3 and a half bitcoin cash”.

 Traditional currencies are typically coins, paper bills, and amounts in bank, brokerage, or other accounts. bitcoin and bitcoin cash (and other cryptocurrencies) are a type of currency that exists in the form of _private keys_, with each private key representing a particular amount of the currency. Usually, only one person or organization knows a particular private key and hence “owns” the cryptocurrency that the private key represents.

The amount of currency associated with a private key can be split into parts, each part then having its own private key, and whose sum is the same as the amount represented by the original private key. Alternately, private keys can be combined into a new private key which represents the amount of the sum of the combined private keys.

**bitcoin cash Transaction**
A transaction is the exchange of a quantity of BCH between two people. One person sends BCH to another, and the other person receives the BCH. The information specifying this transaction is grouped with the information describing other transactions into a _block_ of transactions by Bitcoin Cash _miners_. Once the block has been validated by the BCH network and added to the *blockchain*, the transactions in that block are *confirmed*.

**Block**
One or more BCH transactions, grouped together with an identifying block header. See Blockchain below for more detail.

**Block Validation**
Once a minor has successfully mined a block, it is sent to all other BCH nodes on the BCH network for validation. Each node checks to see if the new block has been correctly mined and then, after this validation, appends to the blockchain that it maintains. In the somewhat rare case when two miners each mine different blocks and simultaneously sent them to the BCH network, some of the nodes might validate one of the blocks and others might validate the other block. The Bitcoin Cash node software automatically resolves this situation, usually when the next block is mined, and one of the two prior simultaneous blocks is deleted from the blockchain and the other is adopted by all nodes.

**Blockchain**
The BCH blockchain is the place where all BCH transactions that have ever been validated are stored. Approximately once every ten minutes, a group of BCH transactions are packaged into a so called 'block' of transactions and validated by the nodes of the BCH network. Once validated, the new block is added to the chain of blocks that have previously been validated. All the transactions in the blockchain can be examined by anyone at any time. This, for example, allows Bitcoin Unlimited to check that the BCH in a new incoming transaction belongs to the wallet spending it and that the BCH involved hasn't previously been spent. Besides storing transactions, each block stores the _hash_ of the previous block and the hash of the block itself, thereby forming a chain of blocks. This prevents anyone getting away with altering data in a block, as altering any data would cause the hash of the block to change and the changed hash would not match the hash that is stored in the next block in the chain. Finally, the blockchain is distributed, with many copies of the entire blockchain are stored all over the world. In order for a bad actor to change data stored in a block, he or she would have to change data in a block and all blocks forward in the chain in over 50% of the blockchains stored worldwide. Bitcoin Cash mining software ensures that this would require such a huge amount of time and computational power that it could never practicably be done.

**Committed Transaction and Confirmed Transaction**
Once a block of transactions have been validated by the Bitcoin Cash network, the block is added to the blockchain. Recipients of transactions large transactions often wait until the block containing their transaction is six blocks deep in the blockchain before considering the transaction as confirmed. Recipients of transactions involving smaller amounts often consider their transaction confirmed as soon as the block containing their transaction has been added to the blockchain, or is only 2 or 3 blocks deep. Recipients take this action because the probability of a block being declared invalid reduces greatly as it gets deeper in the blockchain.

**Private Key**

**QR Code**
The Bitcoin Cash QR code is used by a BCH recipient to communicate to the BCH sender the address to which the BCH is to be sent and optionally a message.

**Simplified Payment Validation (SPV)**
A method for verifying if particular transactions are included in a block without downloading the entire block. The method is used by some lightweight Bitcoin Cash clients.
