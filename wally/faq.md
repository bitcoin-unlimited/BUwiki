## What is a mBCH?
mBCH stands for millibitcoincash. Each mBCH is one thousandth of a BCH.

## How do you share a Wally BCH address?
Touch the address immediately underneath the word "Receive", and that address will be copied to the clipboard of your device. 

 1. If you want to send the address via gmail, select the gmail icon in the green band at the top of the Wally app. An email will be displayed with the Wally bitcoincash address automatically inserted into the body of the email. Fill in the email's "To" field and send it. 
 2. Alternately, select the share icon in the green band at the top of the Wally app. A drop down menu will be displayed that will give you various options, such as mail or messages, that you can select to share the Wally bitcoincash address.

## How do I get an address to which I want to send mBCH into the send address field?
Simply copy an address into your device's clipboard, and it will automatically be loaded into the send address field.

## Using Wally, how do you specify the amount of BCH that you want to send in terms of the LOCAL CURRENCY?
First, choose the local currency by selecting the Settings symbol at the top right of the Wally screen.  At the top of the Settings page, use the pull down menu to select the local currency of your choice.  Once a local currency is set it will remain set unless you use Settings to change it.  

On the main Wally page, below SEND, there is an address line showing the address to which the BCH will be sent. Below the address line is the AMOUNT line where you enter the "send quantity" of mBCH or local currency that you wish to send.  If you wish to change the type of currency shown next to the "send quantity" field, select the down arrow to the right of the currency, and then choose either your local currency or mBCH from the pull down list.

## How do we split a bill using Wally?
When you pay a bill, other people with whom you are equally sharing the expense can easily send you their portion of the bill. Under "Receive" on the Wally main page, select "SPLIT A BILL". On the page that is displayed, fill in the total amount of the bill and the tip. You can enter a specific tip amount or select the percentage tip by touching the arrow to the right of "Tip". Next, select the number of ways you are splitting the bill.  The amount each person will be paying is then shown in mBCH and in the local currency, and a QR code is displayed to make it easy for people to send you mBCH.

## When specifing local currency to send BCH, does Wally use a fair exchange rate?
When you specify an amount in local currency to send to someone, Wally obtains the up-to-date exchange rate for that currency from the BITCOIN.COM web site and uses that exchange rate to calculate the amount of mBCH to be sent. BITCOIN.COM derives its exchange rate from a basket of exchanges. The rate is sort of an average exchange rate. 

Remember that no actual local currency is being sent, just an equivalent value of mBCH is being sent, and there are absolutely no exchange fees involved. Finally, there is always a very remote possibility that for some unforeseen technical reason, the exchange rate might be somehow incorrect.  Wally shows you the exchange rate for one BCH before you send any funds, which you can glance at to confirm that it is reasonable.

## Why does Wally offer multiple accounts?
You can set up multiple accounts by touching the green "+" symbol to the right of the Balance line on Wally's main screen.  One use for having several accounts is to track your spending by, for example, using one account for groceries, one account for purchases of computing equipment, and another account for miscellaneous purchases.
