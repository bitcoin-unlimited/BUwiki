## How do you share a Wally BCH address?
Touch the address immediately underneath the word "Receive", and it will be copied to the clipboard of your device. If you want to send the address via gmail, select the gmail icon in the green band at the top of the Wally app. An email will appear with the Wally bitcoincash address automatically inserted into the body of the email. Fill in the email's "To" field and send it.  Alternately, select the share icon in the green band at the top of the Wally app. A drop down menu will be displayed that will give you various options, such as mail or messages, that you can select to share the Wally bitcoincash address. 

## Using Wally, how do you specify the amount of BCH you want to send in terms of the LOCAL CURRENCY?
First, choose the local currency by selecting the Settings symbol at the top right of the Wally screen.  At the top of the Settings page, use the pull down menu to select the local currency of your choice.  Once a local currency is set it will remain set unless you use Settings to change it.  

On the main Wally page, below SEND there is an address line showing the address to which the BCH will be sent, followed by the Amount field and a currency choice selection pull down list.  If you wish to change the currency shown next to the Amount field, select the down arrow to the right of the currency, and then choose either your local currency or mBCH from the pull down list.

## How do we split a bill using Wally?
When you pay a bill, other people with whom you are equally sharing the expense can easily send you their portion of the bill. Under "Receive" on the Wally main page, select "SPLIT A BILL". On the page that is displayed, fill in the total amount of the bill and the tip. You can enter a specific tip amount or select the percentage tip by touching the arrow to the right of "Tip". Next, select the number of ways you are splitting the bill.  The amount each person will be paying is then shown in mBCH and in the local currency, and a QR code is displayed to make it easy for people to send you mBCH.

## When specifing local currency to send BCH, does Wally use a fair exchange rate?
