## Can you give a SUMMARY OVERVIEW of the Wally wallet?
Yes. The Wally Wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet whose design center is ease of use, simplicity, and useful features. At this point in time, it supports bitcoin cash and local currency conversions. Wally's main screen is used for 90% of what you do with a wallet: sending, receiving, and showing account balances. Wally offers multiple accounts, multiple local currencies, a unique "identity" feature that provides ultra secure logins and information to internet sites, and other useful features.

## What is mBCH?
mBCH stands for milli-bitcoin cash. Each mBCH is one thousandth of a BCH.

## Sending mBCH
The first step in sending mBCH is obtaining the bitcoin cash address to which you want to send the mBCH. Using your email, messaging, or other means, obtain the recipient's bitcoin cash address and copy it into the clipboard of your device. Alternatively, you can use the QR scan symbol on the main screen of Wally to activate the camera on your device to scan in a recipient's address QR. The address will automatically be copied into the **SEND** section of your Wally Wallet.

The **SEND** section at the top of Wally's main page is used to send mBCH.  Use the pull down menu to the right of the words **SEND from** to select account from which the mBCH will be sent. Next, if the recipients address hasn't already automatically appeared on the next line, select the clipboard icon on the right side of Wally's **SEND** line. This will paste the recipient's address from the clipboard into the line below **SEND**. The third and last line of Wally's **SEND** section is used to select the currency type and the amount of currency. At this time, you can choose a local (fiat) currency or mBCH using the pull down menu on the right. Finally enter the send quantity in the **Amount** field and then select the SEND button to complete sending the mBCH. (Note: if you specified an amount of local currency, the equivalent amount of mBCH will sent.)

## How do you send your Wally BCH address to someone who wants to send you BCH?
Your Wally Wallet's BCH address is too long to reliably recite it to someone who is going to send you BCH. Instead, touch the address immediately underneath the word "Receive", and that address will be copied to the clipboard of your device. 

 1. If you want to send the address via gmail, select the gmail icon in the green band at the top of the Wally app. An email will be displayed with the Wally bitcoincash address automatically inserted into the body of the email. Fill in the email's "To" field and send it. 
 2. Alternately, select the share icon in the green band at the top of the Wally app. A drop down menu will be displayed that will give you various options, such as mail, messages, or save-to-drive that you can select and use to share the Wally bitcoincash address. In general, the address will automatically be loaded into the share option chosen.


## How do I get an address to which I want to send mBCH into the send address field?
Simply copy an address into your device's clipboard, and it will automatically be loaded into the send address field.

## Using Wally, how do you specify the amount of BCH that you want to send in terms of the LOCAL CURRENCY?
First, choose the local currency by selecting the Settings symbol at the top right of the Wally screen.  At the top of the Settings page, use the pull down menu to select the local currency of your choice.  Once a local currency is set it will remain set unless you use Settings to change it.  

On the main Wally page, below SEND, there is an address line showing the address to which the BCH will be sent. Below the address line is the AMOUNT line where you enter the "send quantity" of mBCH or local currency that you wish to send.  If you wish to change the type of currency shown next to the "send quantity" field, select the down arrow to the right of the currency, and then choose either your local currency or mBCH from the pull down list.

## How do we split a bill using Wally?
When you pay a bill, other people with whom you are equally sharing the expense can easily send you their portion of the bill. Under "Receive" on the Wally main page, select "SPLIT A BILL". On the page that is displayed, fill in the total amount of the bill and the tip. You can enter a specific tip amount or select the percentage tip by touching the arrow to the right of "Tip". Next, select the number of ways you are splitting the bill.  The amount each person will be paying is then shown in mBCH and in the local currency, and a QR code is displayed to make it easy for people to send you mBCH.

## When specifing local currency to send BCH, does Wally use a fair exchange rate?
When you specify an amount in local currency to send to someone, Wally obtains the up-to-date exchange rate for that currency from the BITCOIN.COM web site and uses that exchange rate to calculate the amount of mBCH to be sent. BITCOIN.COM derives its exchange rate from a basket of exchanges. The rate is sort of an average exchange rate. 

Remember that no actual local currency is being sent, just an equivalent value of mBCH is being sent, and there are absolutely no exchange fees involved. Finally, there is always a very remote possibility that for some unforeseen technical reason, the exchange rate might be somehow incorrect.  Wally shows you the exchange rate for one BCH before you send any funds, which you can glance at to confirm that it is reasonable.

## Why does Wally offer MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS?
You can set up multiple accounts by touching the green "+" symbol to the right of the Balance line on Wally's main screen.  One use for having several accounts is to track your spending by, for example, using one account for business and one account personal expenses. In the future, Wally may support several cryptocurrencies, each of which would have it's own account or accounts.
