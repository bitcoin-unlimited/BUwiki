## Why should I use the Wally Wallet?

## Can you give a SUMMARY OVERVIEW of the Wally Wallet?
Yes. The Wally Wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet whose design center is ease of use, simplicity, and useful features. At this point in time, it supports bitcoin cash and also allows you to specify amounts in local currencies. Wally's main screen is used for 90% of what you do with a wallet: sending, receiving, and showing account balances. Wally offers multiple accounts, multiple local currencies, a unique "identity" feature that provides ultra secure logins and information to internet sites, and other helpful  features.

## What is mBCH?
mBCH stands for milli-bitcoin cash. Each mBCH is one thousandth of a BCH.

## How is my mBCH protected from theft?
At this time, the Wally Wallet does not have it's own password. The password for your device protects Wally from bad actors accessing your wallet. If you keep significant funds in your wallet, it would be a good idea to not let anyone use your device that you wouldn't trust with your traditional paper currency physical wallet. Since Wally is designed for ease of use, it's protection level mirrors that of a physical wallet.

## Sending mBCH
The first step in sending mBCH is obtaining the bitcoin cash address to which you want to send the mBCH. Using your email, messaging, or other means, obtain the recipient's bitcoin cash address and copy it into the clipboard of your device. Alternatively, you can use the QR scan symbol on the main screen of Wally to activate the camera on your device to scan in a recipient's address QR. The address will automatically be copied into the **SEND** section of your Wally Wallet.

The **SEND** section at the top of Wally's home page is used to send mBCH.  Use the pull down menu to the right of the words **SEND from** to select account from which the mBCH will be sent. Next, if the recipients address hasn't already automatically appeared on the next line, select the clipboard icon on the right side of Wally's **SEND** line. This will paste the recipient's address from the clipboard into the line below **SEND**. The third and last line of Wally's **SEND** section is used to select the currency type and the amount of currency. At this time, you can choose a local (fiat) currency or mBCH using the pull down menu on the right. Finally enter the send quantity in the **Amount** field and then select the SEND button to complete sending the mBCH. (Note: if you specified an amount of local currency, the equivalent amount of mBCH will sent.)

## How do I get the address to which I want to send mBCH into the send address field?
Simply copy an address into your device's clipboard, and it will automatically be loaded into the send address field on Wally's home page.

## How do I receive mBCH from another person?
The middle of the Wally home page is used for receiving mBCH. If the sender already has the address of the account into which you want the mBCH sent, you do not have to do anything. The mBCH will appear in your account after it is sent. If you need to provide your address to the sender, use the pull down menu to the right of **Receive into** to select the account into which you want the mBCH sent. The address for that account will appear right below the **Receive into** line and also the QR code for that address will be displayed. Either send your address to the sender (see the next FAQ) or have them scan the displayed QR code.

## How do I send my Wally BCH address to someone who wants to send me BCH?
Your Wally Wallet's BCH address is too long to reliably recite it to someone who is going to send you BCH. Instead, touch the address immediately underneath the word "Receive" on Wally's home page, and that address will be copied to the clipboard of your device. 

 1. If you want to send the address via gmail, select the gmail icon in the green band at the top of the Wally's home page. An email will be displayed with the Wally bitcoin cash address automatically inserted into the body of the email. Fill in the email's "To" field and send it. 
 2. Alternately, select the share icon in the green band at the top of Wally's home page. A drop down menu will be displayed that will give you various options, such as mail, messages, or save-to-drive that you can select and use to share the Wally bitcoin cash address. In general, the address will automatically be loaded into the share option chosen.


## Using Wally, how do you specify the amount of BCH that you want to send in terms of the LOCAL CURRENCY?
First, choose the local currency by selecting the Settings symbol (a gear) at the top right of the Wally home page.  At the top of the Settings page, use the pull down menu to select the local currency of your choice.  Once a local currency is set it will remain set unless you use Settings to change it.  

On Wally's home page, below SEND, there is an address line showing the address to which the BCH will be sent. Below the address line is the AMOUNT line where you enter the "send quantity" of mBCH or local currency that you wish to send.  If you wish to change the type of currency shown next to the "send quantity" field, select the down arrow to the right of the currency, and then choose either your local currency or mBCH from the pull down list.

## How do we split a bill using Wally?
When you pay a bill, other people with whom you are equally sharing the expense can easily send you their portion of the bill. Under "Receive" on the Wally home page, select "SPLIT A BILL". On the page that is displayed, fill in the total amount of the bill and the tip. You can enter a specific tip amount or select the percentage tip by touching the arrow to the right of "Tip". Next, select the number of ways you are splitting the bill.  The amount each person will be paying is then shown in mBCH and in the local currency, and your address QR code is displayed to make it easy for people to send you mBCH.

## When specifying local currency to send BCH, does Wally use a fair exchange rate?
When you specify an amount in local currency to send to someone, Wally obtains the up-to-date exchange rate for that currency from the BITCOIN.COM web site and uses that exchange rate to calculate the amount of mBCH to be sent. BITCOIN.COM derives its exchange rate from a basket of exchanges. The rate is sort of an average exchange rate. 

Remember that no actual local currency is being sent, just an equivalent value of mBCH is being sent, and there are absolutely no exchange fees involved. Finally, there is always a very remote possibility that for some unforeseen technical reason, the exchange rate might be somehow incorrect.  Wally shows you the exchange rate for one BCH before you send any funds, which you can glance at to confirm that it is reasonable.

## Why does Wally offer MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS? How do I set up additional accounts?
One use for having several accounts is to track your spending by, for example, using one account for business and one account personal expenses. In the future, Wally may support several cryptocurrencies, each of which would have it's own account or accounts.

You can set up multiple accounts by touching the green "+" symbol to the right of the Balance line on Wally's home page. The **New Account** page will be displayed. Enter an account name of your choice. Account names can be from 1 to 8 characters (letters, numbers, or symbols) long.



## What information does Wally show me about my account balances?
 The lower section of Wally's home page shows a list of your accounts and their balances. Balances are are shown in mBCH. If the amount shown is green, all send transactions for the account have been settled. If an orange amount is shown to the right or the green amount, one or more send transactions are in progress. The green amount is the mBCH you have available for sending, and the orange amount shows the amount of mBCH in the account's addresses from which sent amounts are being extracted. When the sends are settled, the orange amount will disappear and the green amount will be the total mBCH for that account.
 
## How does the IDENTITY feature make my life easier?
Once you've set up your identity for a supported web site, you can use Wally to log into that web site on any device in an ultra secure manner. Just select the QR scan button on Wally's home page and use your device to scan the QR code on the web site's login page. Not only will you be logged in but additional information that you have pre-approved will be sent to the web site, such as your name, address, credit card number, or telephone number. This saves you from having to supply such information every time you log in. 

## How do I enter my identity information.
Select the Identity icon at the bottom of Wally's home page.  The **Identity** page will be displayed. A list of web sites that support the Identity feature is displayed. Select one of these web sites and a page showing a list of your identity information is displayed along with a switch for each item on the list. Items supported by the web site are in black, and identity items not supported are in grey. (Note to self: How does one populate the identity info. Has this been implemented yet?)  Turn on the switch for any item that you wish to pass to the web site when logging in.  (How does one get a URL onto the web site list?)
